# Project Proposal: Sewage Discharge Awareness Website

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** *Dirty Water*  
**Objective:** Build a public-facing website that empowers people to make informed decisions about when and where itâ€™s safe to swim, surf, paddleboard, or walk near coastal or river water, based on near-time sewage discharge data.

## Target Audience

- Environmentally conscious individuals
- Families with children
- Surfers, swimmers, and dog walkers
- Outdoor enthusiasts
- Local community groups
- Anyone who wants to avoid unnecessary health risks from polluted water

## Idea

**Problem:**  
Sewage is often discharged into rivers and the sea during storms or system overloads, but this information is often hard to understand, does not give advice or allows users to easily complain to local water companies.

**Solution:**  
Create a simple, mobile-friendly website where users can check recent sewage discharge events at their local river or beach, learn about the risks, and take action if they wish.

2. ** Sewage Discharge Points**  
   Each point on the map includes:
   - Location name
   - Last known discharge event (with date/time)
   - Length of discharge (time)

3. ** Health & Safety Advice**  
   - Guidance on how long to avoid water after discharge
   - Symptoms to watch for
